## Cross-Ecosystem Comparison

<think>The user wants me to generate a cross-project comparison report for the AI agent ecosystem based on the project digests I've created. Let me analyze the data from all five projects and create a comprehensive comparison report.

Let me first summarize the key data from each project:

**OpenClaw** (github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
- Issues: 500 updated in last 24h (458 open, 42 closed)
- PRs: 500 updated in last 24h (376 open, 124 merged/closed)
- Releases: 0
- Focus: Enterprise AI assistant with emphasis on cost control, session management, memory optimization

**Hermes Agent** (github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent)
- Issues: 50 (36 open, 14 closed)
- PRs: 50 (24 open, 26 merged/closed)
- Releases: 0
- Focus: Windows platform issues, desktop update loops, OAuth, security

**IronClaw** (github.com/nearai/ironclaw)
- Issues: 0 updated
- PRs: 2 (both open)
- Releases: 0
- Focus: Time operations, runtime fixes, minimal activity

**QwenPaw** (github.com/agentscope-ai/QwenPaw)
- Issues: 12 (all open/active)
- PRs: 13 (all open)
- Releases: 0
- Focus: Console UI, context management, multi-platform support

**ZeroClaw** (github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw)
- Issues: 50 (37 open, 13 closed)
- PRs: 50 (41 open, 9 merged/closed)
- Releases: 0
- Focus: Security, OIDC, RPC, plugin architecture, SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)


- 
Looking at the landscape, I see these projects cluster around a few technical priorities. Security and authentication are fundamental across all of them—ZeroClaw and Hermes Agent are both investing heavily in OIDC and OAuth implementations. Memory management and session stability are equally critical, with OpenClaw particularly focused on the 77MB per-turn leak and Hermes Agent addressing similar persistence issues. The console and UI layer is where QwenPaw and Hermes Agent converge, both building more robust interfaces for their platforms.

Beyond the core infrastructure, I'm noticing a pattern around agent orchestration: ZeroClaw's SOP framework, OpenClaw's cost budgeting, and Hermes Agent's delegation features all point toward better control over how agents operate and interact. Windows support remains a pain point specifically for Hermes, while cross-platform concerns dominate elsewhere.</think>

# Cross-Project Ecosystem Report — AI Agent / Personal Assistant Landscape

## 1. Ecosystem Overview

The personal AI assistant and agent open-source ecosystem is experiencing a period of intense maturation and architectural evolution. Across the five analyzed projects—**OpenClaw**, **Hermes Agent**, **IronClaw**, **QwenPaw**, and **ZeroClaw**—the community is collectively tackling foundational challenges: security hardening (authentication, authorization, OIDC), runtime reliability (memory management, session persistence), and user experience refinement (console UI, cross-platform support). No project published a release in the last 24 hours, suggesting a phase of active development rather than release cadence. The landscape is polarized between large-scale enterprise-focused projects (OpenClaw: 500 issues/PRs daily) and smaller, specialized efforts (IronClaw: minimal activity). Common themes include the shift toward plugin-based architectures, per-agent resource governance, and durable message delivery semantics.

## User Feedback Summary

### Pain Points

1. **Windows Platform Instability** — Multiple Windows users reporting gateway crashes after updating to PM runtime. The venv overlay issue causes pydantic_core ABI mismatches. This is the top-reported problem today.

2. **Desktop Update Loops** — Developers using source installs report endless rebuild loops on every backend boot. This disrupts active development workflows.

3. **macOS Multi-User Blocking** — Fast User Switching blocked for 20-30 seconds when the gateway runs, affecting team environments.

4. **OAuth Persistence Failures** — Users complete OAuth flows successfully but credentials are not saved, particularly for profile-scoped and Codex auth.

### Satisfaction Signals

- The WAL-generation gap fix (#121360) addresses a long-standing database stability issue
- Security fixes for MCP cross-profile adoption and Mattermost attachments show responsiveness to multi-tenant concerns
- Desktop UI improvements (profile identity in tabs, inline preview colors) indicate attention to user experience

# IronClaw Project Digest — 2026-09-26

## 1. Today's Overview

Project activity on 2026-09-26 shows low engagement with **2 pull requests updated in the last 24 hours** and **no issues or releases**. Both active PRs are open and not yet merged. The repository maintains a minimal change footprint today, suggesting either a stable state or potential quiet period in the development cycle. The codebase knowledge graph refresh workflow (PR #7988) indicates ongoing CI infrastructure maintenance, while the substantial feature addition in PR #8108 demonstrates continued investment in the `builtin.time` functionality. No critical stability or community concerns were raised today.

---

## 2. Releases

**No new releases** were published in the last 24 hours. The project currently has no recorded releases in the data.

---

## 3. Project Progress

| PR | Title | Status | Size | Area | Contributor |
|----|-------|--------|------|------|-------------|
| [#8108](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/8108) | fix(host-runtime): add builtin.time shift and typed input issues | **OPEN** | XL | Runtime/Standard Library | new |
| [#7988](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/pull/7988) | chore(agents): refresh codebase knowledge graph | **OPEN** | XS | CI/Infrastructure | core |

**Today's Activity:** Zero merged or closed PRs. Two PRs remain open and under review.

**PR #8108 Analysis:** This is a **large feature addition** (XL size) introducing signed time shift operations to `builtin.time`. Key capabilities include:
- `operation: "shift"` for signed seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks
- Support for relative shifts from explicit timestamps or "now"
- Fixed durations for days and weeks
- Wide accumulator for representable signed cancellation

**PR #7988 Analysis:** A routine CI maintenance task that updates the committed codebase-memory bootstrap snapshot from the current default branch, generated by the nightly `Codebase Graph Refresh` workflow.

---

## 4. Community Hot Topics

No issues or pull requests received comments, reactions, or significant community engagement in the last 24 hours. Both open PRs show **0 reactions (👍)** and no recorded comments. This indicates a quiet community day with no active discussions or debates requiring analyst attention.

---

## 5. Bugs & Stability

**No bugs, crashes, or regressions** were reported in the last 24 hours. The project shows no stability-related issues in the current data snapshot.

---

## 6. Feature Requests & Roadmap Signals

**PR #8108** represents the most substantial feature work visible today:
- **Enhanced time manipulation**: Adds signed time shift capabilities to `builtin.time`, addressing gaps in temporal arithmetic
- **Typed input improvements**: Likely includes improvements to type handling for time-related inputs (not fully detailed in summary)
- **Scope**: Runtime and standard library enhancement

This PR, being XL in size and addressing core runtime functionality, suggests this feature may be targeted for an upcoming release. The addition of signed time shifts fills a meaningful gap in time-based operations, which is often a requested capability in agent runtimes.

---

## 7. User Feedback Summary

No direct user feedback (issues, comments, or reactions) was recorded in the last 24 hours. The project digest cannot surface real user pain points or satisfaction indicators from the current data window.

| **[#8850](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/8850)** | Tracker | **Move optional channels & tools from compile-time features to runtime plugins** — binary size reduction |
| **[#10993](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10993)** | Feature | **Complete the public runtime composition boundary** — enables embedding runtime with explicit capabilities |
| **[#8288](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/8288)** | Tracker | **SOP milestone: daemon-owned SOP control plane to 5/5** — 13 capabilities in progress |
| **[#8358](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/8358)** | Tracker | **ZeroRelay native transport and v0.9.0 readiness** |
| **[#11103](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/11103)** | Feature | **Add Cheaper Inference as a typed OpenAI-compatible provider** |

### Roadmap Signals

The cluster of OIDC/security PRs (#11082, #10259, #10263, #10321) indicates **security infrastructure is near completion**. The runtime composition work (#10993, #6864) and plugin migration (#6489, #8850) suggest **modularity** is a 2026-2027 priority. Host-scoped resource bounds (#10970) addresses multi-agent operational scaling.

## User Feedback Summary

Based on issue activity, key pain points include:

1. **Channel registration failure** — Issue #11055 (daemon channel-map factory) blocks webhook, cron, and SOP tools in production deployments
2. **CI latency** — Issue #7108 highlights developer frustration with 15-20 min builds for small PRs
3. **Message delivery ambiguity** — RFC #10929 (delivery receipts) and #10930 (durable questions) address agents' inability to confirm human communication success
4. **Multi-agent resource contention** — RFC #10970 requests host-level admission control for machines running many agents

Positive signals: Agent export feature (#9986 merged) addresses portability needs; OIDC consolidation into single PR (#11082) reflects responsive governance.
