## Cross-Tool Comparison

<think>The user wants me to generate a cross-tool comparison report for AI CLI tools based on the community digests I've already created. Let me analyze all the information from the five tools:

1. **Claude Code** (github.com/anthropics/claude-code)
2. **OpenAI Codex** (github.com/openai/codex)
3. **Gemini CLI** (github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
4. **GitHub Copilot CLI** (github.com/github/copilot-cli)
5. **OpenCode** (github.com/anomalyco/opencode)
6. **Pi** (github.com/earendil-works/pi)
7. **Qwen Code** (github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code)

Let me compile the data:

## Activity Comparison

| Tool | Issues | PRs | Discussions | Releases Today |
|------|--------|-----|-------------|----------------|
| Claude Code | ~50 issues, 40 PRs | 40 PRs | 15 discussions | v2.1.287 |
| OpenAI Codex | ~50 issues | 40+ PRs | 15 discussions | v0.160.0, v0.162.0-alpha.2 |
| Gemini CLI | ~50 issues | 40 PRs | 15 discussions | v0.64.0-nightly.20261002.gc9096a847 |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | ~50 issues | 1 PR | 15 discussions | v1.0.92-0 |
| OpenCode | ~50 issues | 10 PRs | 15 discussions | No releases in last 24h |
| Pi | ~30 issues | 12 PRs | 1 discussion | v1.0.0 |
| Qwen Code | ~20 issues | 10 PRs | N/A | v0.24.7-nightly.20261001.a7deb01bcb |

Now let me identify shared feature directions:


Across the ecosystem, several common themes emerge: plugin and extensibility frameworks (Claude Code Mods, OpenCode plugins, Qwen Code managed agents), multi-model flexibility and BYOK support, MCP improvements and reliability fixes, token optimization strategies, and enhanced session management including persistence and history handling. Security is also a priority, particularly around sandboxing and authentication mechanisms.

Looking at what differentiates each platform, Claude Code emphasizes extensibility through Mods, OpenCode targets professional developers with enterprise features, Gemini CLI focuses on CLI-centric workflows with state persistence, GitHub Copilot CLI centers on GitHub integration, and Qwen Code is pioneering Managed Agent architectures with dual-path approaches.</think>

# Cross-Tool Comparison: AI CLI Tools Ecosystem Report

## 1. Ecosystem Overview

The AI CLI tools landscape in late 2026 shows a mature but rapidly evolving ecosystem. Major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, GitHub) have shipped production-grade CLIs with distinct philosophical approaches—from Claude Code's plugin-centric extensibility to Qwen Code's managed agent architecture. Meanwhile, community-driven projects (OpenCode, Pi, Qwen Code) demonstrate that independent development continues to push innovation in token optimization, memory management, and multi-provider flexibility. The convergence around MCP (Model Context Protocol) as a standard for tool interoperability is now nearly universal, though implementations vary significantly in reliability and feature completeness.

| **Qwen Code** | ~20 (active) | ~10 | N/A* | v0.24.7-nightly.20261001 |

*Qwen Code does not use Discussions; uses Issues exclusively.

**Notes:**

- All major tools show healthy activity levels with significant community engagement
- Pi and Qwen Code are more lean in issue volume but maintain active PR pipelines
- OpenCode has lower PR volume despite high issue activity—suggests stricter review or smaller core team

---

## 3. Shared Feature Directions

| **Copilot CLI** | GitHub ecosystem, sandbox automation | GitHub users, enterprise IT | CA trust automation, MCP OAuth, sandboxed commands |
| **OpenCode** | Provider flexibility, cost transparency | Multi-cloud users | Multi-provider support, cost reporting, lean deployments |
| **Pi** | Managed agent lifecycle, durability | Advanced multi-agent workflows | Dual-path architecture, durable sessions, token governance |
| **Qwen Code** | Managed agent platform, security | Enterprise multi-tenant | Broker authentication, workspace binding, staged delivery |

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Claude Code** leads in extensibility with Mods; **Qwen Code** pursues managed agent architecture with broker authentication
- **Copilot CLI** differentiates on GitHub ecosystem tight integration; **OpenCode** on multi-provider flexibility
- **Pi** uniquely targets managed agent durability with lifecycle management
- **Gemini CLI** emphasizes CLI-native UX with aggressive memory optimization

---

## 5. Community Momentum & Maturity

### High Momentum (Active Development)
- **Claude Code** — 230+ comment issue (#91870 on Mods), v2.1.287 shipped with major features, high community engagement
- **Gemini CLI** — Active security (gVisor/ACP fixes), memory optimization (ChatRecordingService), performance work
- **Qwen Code** — Strong architectural work (dual-path managed agents), security hardening, durable sessions

### Moderate Momentum (Steady Progress)
- **OpenAI Codex** — Consistent releases, Windows reliability focus, but fewer community discussions
- **Pi** — v1.0.0 major release, shrinkwrap fix in progress, active security patches
- **Copilot CLI** — Maintenance mode with targeted fixes, lower community volume but stable

### Lower Activity (Fewer Contributors)
- **OpenCode** — Lower PR volume despite high issue count; potential bottleneck in review

### Maturity Indicators
- **Copilot CLI** — Mature enterprise features (CA trust, unattended setup)
- **Claude Code** — Established plugin ecosystem with Mods extension
- **Qwen Code** — Early-stage but architecturally sophisticated (managed agents, broker auth)

---

## 6. Trend Signals

### Signals for Decision-Makers

1. **Extensibility is the next battlefield** — Claude Code's Mods, OpenCode plugins, and Qwen Code managed hooks indicate that base functionality is table-stakes; differentiation now comes from how deeply third parties can customize behavior.

2. **MCP is becoming infrastructure** — Every tool is investing in MCP reliability (retry logic, OAuth refresh, connection handling). The protocol has won; implementation maturity varies.

3. **Token optimization is a primary concern** — Multiple communities flag token waste from system prompts, tool schemas, and context files. Expect aggressive caching, lazy loading, and AST-aware tools to become standard.

4. **Session durability is a premium feature** — Managed agent architectures (Pi, Qwen Code) and session recovery (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) show that long-running, interruptible workflows are increasingly expected.

5. **Windows enterprise support remains uneven** — Despite years of development, Windows-specific bugs persist (console flashing, sandbox setup, path handling). Organizations with Windows-first workflows face more friction.

6. **Security is tightening** — Broker authentication (Qwen Code), HTTPS enforcement (Copilot CLI), confinement guards (Qwen Code), and sandbox improvements across tools indicate a shift toward enterprise-ready security postures.

### Developer Takeaway

If choosing an AI CLI tool today:

- **For maximum extensibility**: Claude Code
- **For GitHub-integrated workflows**: Copilot CLI  
- **For multi-provider flexibility**: OpenCode
- **For CLI-native pure experience**: Gemini CLI
- **For managed agent platforms**: Pi or Qwen Code

<think>Let me analyze the GitHub data provided and create a structured digest for the Claude Code community.

First, let me organize the information:

**Releases:**
- v2.1.287 - Latest release
  - Added Claude Mods: plugins may now modify deeper behavior
  - Added "You should know" - a built-in mod where a side agent watches your back and flags things you or Claude might miss

**Issues (sorted by comment count):**
1. #91870 - Mods - make Claude 10x more extensible (230 comments, 130 👍) - enhancement, area:hooks, area:plugins
2. #71542 - GitHub connector links repositories but Claude cannot access content (68 comments, 64 👍) - bug, area:permissions
3. #97854 - Auto mode: server-side safety classifier blocks Bash and ScheduleWakeup (28 comments, 35 👍) - bug, area:permissions
4. #84862 - Passkey (WebAuthn) sign-in for Claude accounts (10 comments, 84 👍) - enhancement, area:auth
5. #83848 - Background subagents intermittently stall (9 comments, 0 👍) - area:agents
6. #98184 - Network change causes 184s hang on dead connection (5 comments, 0 👍) - bug, platform:linux, area:networking
7. #81024 - VS Code extension: include git-worktree sessions (5 comments, 6 👍) - enhancement, area:ide
8. #98836 - spawn_task chip: cloud drops prompt/brief (3 comments, 0 👍) - bug, area:agents - CLOSED
9. #98679 - Claude Opus 5.5 behavior shift (~2x thinking, ~1.6x output) (3 comments, 1 👍) - bug, area:cost, area:model


10. #89827 - Markdown emphasis broken with CJK punctuation (2 comments, 1 👍) - bug, platform:macos, area:tui

I notice several authentication and platform-specific issues emerging. The GitHub connector problem (#71542) prevents content access despite successful repository linking, which is critical. The Auto mode safety classifier (#97854) completely blocking Bash and ScheduleWakeup tools represents a significant functionality gap. Passkey authentication (#84862) is highly desired by the community with strong support, while background subagent stalls (#83848) and network timeout problems (#98184) on Linux are causing noticeable friction.

Additional concerns include VS Code extension worktree handling (#81024), Opus 5.5 model behavior changes affecting token usage (#98679), and a Japanese localization bug with Markdown emphasis (#89827). Platform-specific problems like Windows sleep inhibition (#89110), MCP null argument handling (#98779), and Terminal startup delays (#98832) round out the active issues. Two bugs were closed: #98836 involving cloud prompt handling and #98837 related to spawn tasks.

Looking at recent pull requests, several address display and plugin behaviors. One fix resolves a shell operator safety warning, another updates security guidance documentation, and a third ensures the diff pane only opens when there are actual files to display. A revert was needed for agent Markdown handling and diff color forcing.</think>

# Claude Code Community Digest — 2026-10-02

## Today's Highlights

The v2.1.287 release introduces **Claude Mods**, a major extensibility upgrade enabling plugins to modify deeper Claude behavior. A new built-in "You should know" mod provides a side agent that flags things you or Claude might miss. Meanwhile, the community is actively debating extensibility tradeoffs in issue #91870 (230 comments), and a significant GitHub connector regression (#71542) is blocking repository content access entirely.

Several performance and core fixes are flagged as p1 priority, particularly around file reading logic, ignore filtering optimizations, and session history management. The selection confirm interaction needs attention as well.</think>

# Gemini CLI Community Digest — 2026-10-02

## Today's Highlights

The v0.64.0-nightly.20261002.gc9096a847 release delivers two critical fixes: append-only delta patching for chat history to reduce memory overhead, and atomic state persistence with corruption recovery. Meanwhile, the community is grappling with several high-priority agent reliability issues—particularly around subagent termination reporting and generalist agent hangs that block core workflows.

## Feature Request Trends

1. **Agent Reliability & Recovery** — Multiple issues (#22323, #21409, #21983) highlight the need for robust termination handling, hang detection, and cross-platform (Wayland) support.
2. **Smarter Tool & Skill Invocation** — Requests for the model to autonomously invoke custom skills/subagents (#21968) rather than requiring explicit prompting.
3. **AST-Aware Codebase Operations** — Ongoing investigation (#22745, #22746, #22747) into using AST grep and similar tools to reduce token bloat and improve surgical code reads.
4. **Sandboxing & Security** — Proposal for zero-dependency OS sandboxing (#19873) aligned with post-execution intent routing.
5. **Persistent Task Tracking** — Desire to replace in-context todo lists with file-based CRUD operations (#18836) to survive session boundaries.
6. **Subagent Visibility** — Request for subagent trajectories to be visible via `/chat share` (#22598) for easier eval and debugging.

---

## Developer Pain Points

- **Agent Hangs & Interruption Failures** — The generalist agent hanging on simple operations (#21409) and `Ctrl+C` not reliably reaching cancellation handlers (#29586) are blocking productivity.
- **State Corruption & Data Loss** — Recent fixes (#29584, #29558) address long-standing issues where session history or state.json can be lost on quick exit or corruption.
- **Configuration Override Ignored** — Browser agent ignoring `settings.json` overrides (#22267) creates inconsistent behavior.
- **Context Bloat** — Binary assets being included in context (#29457) and lack of surgical file reads (#19561) drive unnecessary token consumption.
- **Platform Incompatibilities** — Wayland failures (#21983), Windows IME cursor misalignment (#29560), and Windows file locking during extension updates (#29540) indicate ongoing cross-platform gaps.

<summary><strong>GitHub Copilot CLI</strong> — <a href="https://github.com/github/copilot-cli">github/copilot-cli</a></summary>

<think>Let me analyze the GitHub data provided and create a structured digest for the GitHub Copilot CLI community.

First, let me organize the information:

**Releases (last 24h):**
- v1.0.92-0: Fixed MCP tools continuing to work after OAuth reauthentication when tool definitions are unchanged
- v1.0.91: Added `copilot sandbox ca` commands, session timelines fix, sandboxed commands on Windows
- v1.0.91-1: Same as v1.0.91 with additional telemetry flush improvement

**Issues (top 30 by comment count):**
1. #3282 [CLOSED] - Add multiple BYOK model capability (12 comments, 31 👍)
2. #953 [OPEN] - Over excessive permissions request (8 comments, 5 👍)
3. #4998 [OPEN] - MCP unusable after macOS update/reboot due to stale `.mcp-writer.binding` (6 comments, 4 👍)
4. #5008 [OPEN] - Startup error "Failed to read model provider attribution: Error: Not authenticated" (6 comments, 5 👍)
5. #4851 [OPEN] - Azure MCP server fails sending HTTP request (5 comments, 8 👍)
6. #2793 [CLOSED] - Agent internal markers leak into output due to PTY read boundary truncation on Linux (3 comments)
7. #4959 [OPEN] - Enterprise managed `model` setting not applied (2 comments, 3 👍)
8. #2303 [CLOSED] - Unable to retrieve old session by id (2 comments)
9. #5034 [OPEN] - Add setting to hide verbose MCP status notifications (1 comment)


10. #5023 [OPEN] - Session resume fails when masked code-change metrics make session.shutdown counters strings (1 comment)

The remaining issues cover worktree configuration problems, enterprise authentication routing issues, MCP server matching failures, scheduled prompt malfunctions, Windows-specific behavior with command prompt windows, and duplicate message handling when editing queued messages.

Additional problems include AI model stalling during file operations, Windows path handling causing instructions to load twice, background sub-agent stream problems, and STDIO MCP servers not persisting across new sessions. Image handling after rewinding, update freezing, unnecessary "Task complete" summaries, and co-authorship complications with Copilot-Session commits also surfaced as issues. Users are also encountering permission errors when enabling autopilot mid-task, custom agent launch failures, quota usage visibility gaps, and pull request creation problems in remote environments.</think>

# GitHub Copilot CLI Community Digest

**Date:** October 2, 2026

---

## Today's Highlights

The GitHub Copilot CLI team released **v1.0.92-0** with a critical fix for MCP tools that stopped working after OAuth reauthentication. The recent v1.0.91 release introduced important new functionality including `copilot sandbox ca` commands for proxy CA trust management with unattended Windows support, plus improved telemetry handling and session timeline fixes. Community engagement remains high with 38 issues updated in the last 24 hours.

---

## Releases

### v1.0.92-0 (October 2, 2026)
**Fixed:** MCP tools continue working after OAuth reauthentication when tool definitions are unchanged.

### v1.0.91 / v1.0.91-1 (October 1, 2026)
**Added:**
- New `copilot sandbox ca` commands: `check`, `create`, `trust`, `rotate`, and `remove` for proxy CA trust management
- Unattended Windows setup support for CA trust
- `/sandbox ca install` replaced with separate `create` and `trust` commands

**Improved:**
- Session timelines now clear busy status after interrupted turns
- Sandboxed commands now run on Windows
- CLI shutdown flushes pending telemetry before exit with bounded delay

---

## Hot Issues

### 1. [Add multiple BYOK model capability in copilot cli](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/3282) — #3282
**Status:** CLOSED | **Comments:** 12 | **Reactions:** 31 👍
**Why it matters:** Users want to enable multiple Bring-Your-Own-Key (BYOK) models through environment variables. Currently, switching between BYOK models requires terminating the session and setting new environment variables, which disrupts workflow. This highly-upvoted request (31 👍) indicates strong demand for multi-model support in the CLI.

### 2. [Over excessive permissions Request](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/953) — #953
**Status:** OPEN | **Comments:** 8 | **Reactions:** 5 👍
**Why it matters:** Enterprise users are concerned about Copilot requesting read/write access to all repositories during authentication, even when they only intend to work in a single repo. This ongoing issue highlights the need for more granular permission controls.

### 3. [Copilot CLI unusable after macOS update/reboot because `.mcp-writer.binding` persists stale filesystem device ID](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/4998) — #4998
**Status:** OPEN | **Comments:** 6 | **Reactions:** 4 👍
**Why it matters:** After installing macOS security updates and rebooting, all Copilot CLI sessions become unable to process prompts due to stale filesystem device IDs in the `.mcp-writer.binding` file. This renders the CLI completely unusable until users manually intervene.

### 4. [Startup error "Failed to read model provider attribution: Error: Not authenticated" in 1.0.89](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/5008) — #5008
**Status:** OPEN | **Comments:** 6 | **Reactions:** 5 👍
**Why it matters:** Users see authentication errors twice at startup before sign-in completes ~3 seconds later. This appears to be a startup race condition where the CLI attempts model provider attribution before authentication completes. While functionality works after the delay, the error messages are confusing.

### 5. [Azure MCP server fails sending HTTP request](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/4851) — #4851
**Status:** OPEN | **Comments:** 5 | **Reactions:** 8 👍
**Why it matters:** Copilot CLI fails with BrokenPipe errors when validating Azure API Center MCP registry endpoints. This is a regression that breaks existing enterprise workflows using Azure MCP servers—marked as "triage" indicating active investigation.

### 6. [Enterprise managed `model` setting is received but not applied](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/4959) — #4959
**Status:** OPEN | **Comments:** 2 | **Reactions:** 3 👍
**Why it matters:** Enterprise-managed settings like `"model": "auto"` are fetched from policy but not actually applied in the runtime. The model resolver defaults to a different value instead of respecting the enterprise policy, undermining IT administrators' configuration efforts.

### 7. [Add setting to hide verbose MCP status notifications](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/5034) — #5034
**Status:** OPEN | **Comments:** 1 | **Reactions:** 0
**Why it matters:** Users want a setting to suppress verbose MCP connection/disconnection and tool-availability notifications shown at session startup and during sessions. The proposed solution is a user-level setting like `mcp.showStatusNotifications: false`.

### 8. [Session resume fails when masked code-change metrics make session.shutdown counters strings](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/5023) — #5023
**Status:** OPEN | **Comments:** 1 | **Reactions:** 0
**Why it matters:** Persisted CLI sessions can become permanently unresumable when code-change counters in tool telemetry are stored as masked strings instead of numbers. This data corruption breaks session resume functionality entirely.

### 9. [Windows: VS Code agent host loads ~/.copilot/instructions twice](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/5022) — #5022
**Status:** OPEN | **Comments:** 1 | **Reactions:** 1 👍
**Why it matters:** On Windows, personal instructions files under `~/.copilot/instructions` are injected into the session twice due to drive-letter case mismatch in deduplication logic. This causes duplicated content and unexpected behavior.

### 10. [DNS broken for Linux Sandbox when using systemd-resolved stub resolver](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/5027) — #5027
**Status:** OPEN | **Comments:** 0 | **Reactions:** 0
**Why it matters:** When running sandbox on Linux with systemd-resolved, DNS queries fail because the sandbox inherits `/etc/resolv.conf` pointing to `127.0.0.53`, which is unreachable from inside the sandbox container.

## Key PR Progress

### 1. [#5036: Update default model version in README](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/pull/5036)
**Status:** OPEN | **Author:** mjgard
Documentation update to reflect the current default model for Copilot CLI.

---

## Feature Request Trends

Analyzing the issue queue reveals several dominant feature directions:

1. **Multi-Model Support:** Multiple BYOK models (#3282) and enterprise model settings application (#4959) indicate strong demand for flexible model selection.

2. **MCP Improvements:** MCP server reliability after macOS updates (#4998), Azure MCP HTTP failures (#4851), and verbose notification controls (#5034) show MCP is becoming a critical workflow component.

3. **Permission Granularity:** Users want fine-grained control over repository access (#953) and enterprise-managed allow lists for MCP servers (#4989).

4. **Session Management:** Worktree configuration (#3675), session resume reliability (#5023, #2303), and session naming consistency are recurring themes.

5. **Windows Experience:** Command window flashing (#3171), path handling for instructions (#5022), and CA trust automation for unattended setups show Windows enterprise needs.

---

## Developer Pain Points

The most impactful recurring frustrations:

1. **Reliability After Updates:** macOS updates render CLI unusable (#4998)—users need predictable behavior across system changes.

2. **Startup Errors:** Authentication race conditions (#5008) create confusing error messages even when functionality works.

3. **Session Persistence:** Sessions becoming permanently unresumable due to data corruption (#5023) undermines the core value of session continuity.

4. **Enterprise Configuration Gaps:** Enterprise-managed settings not being applied (#4959), permission overreach concerns (#953), and GHEC data residency routing issues (#4938) frustrate enterprise deployments.

5. **MCP Ecosystem:** STDIO MCP servers failing to load after /new (#4811), Azure MCP regressions (#4851), and serverName matching failures (#4989) indicate growing MCP complexity.

6. **Windows Integration:** CMD window flashing, path case sensitivity, and DNS in sandboxed environments require platform-specific attention.

---

## Feature Request Trends

Based on issue analysis, the following themes dominate feature requests:

1. **Plugin/Core Parity** — Plugins lack access to core session capabilities (#49389)—users want full session enumeration, hidden/ephemeral sessions, and tool-context APIs exposed to plugin developers.

2. **Enhanced Output Control** — Demand for higher output token limits without experimental workarounds (#29363)—users need seamless support for models like DeepSeek (384k) and GPT/Claude (128k).

3. **Cross-Platform Consistency** — Windows-specific issues (console flashing #42440, ResizeObserver freeze #43355) indicate platform parity work is needed.

4. **Better LaTeX Rendering** — Multiple issues (#34407, #39170, #49486) request proper inline/block LaTeX rendering in both CLI and Desktop.

5. **Linux Clipboard Enhancement** — PR #32370 adds primary buffer selection support for Linux—a frequently requested TUI improvement.

---

## Developer Pain Points

The community is vocal about several recurring frustrations:

- **Billing & Subscription Issues** — Multiple Go users report duplicate charges (#52592), subscription activation failures (#49184, #52596), and unexplained model usage (#52367). The "Endpoint unavailable" errors (#43102, #42787, #42750) also suggest upstream reliability problems affecting developer workflow.

- **Configuration Surprises** — Silent behavior like the 32k token cap (#29363) and silent file skipping (#52268) frustrate users who expect predictable behavior.

- **Platform-Specific Bugs** — Windows developers face console flashing (#42440), UI freezes (#43355), and 16-bit binary incompatibility (#37628)—issues that block productive work.

- **API Reliability** — The Zen/Go API returning 500 errors (#35276) with no clear root cause or timeline is a blocker for production use.

- **Cache Behavior Opacity** — Prompt cache misses (#14743) and unexpected caching behavior with new images (#51993) make cost prediction difficult.

# Pi Community Digest — 2026-10-02

## Today's Highlights

The v1.0.0 release brings **fullscreen TUI by default** — a major UI change that also introduces breaking behavior for Home/End keys and has already surfaced issues with inline image rendering and tmux compatibility. Meanwhile, the community is actively addressing long-standing pain points: a shrinkwrap vulnerability fix, OpenRouter cost accuracy improvements, and memory optimization proposals for idle sessions.

---

## Releases

### v1.0.0
- **Fullscreen by default** — The TUI now runs fullscreen. Set `tuiMode` to `"regular"` to keep normal scrollback. See [Terminal and display](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/v1.0.0/packages/coding-agent/docs/settings.md#terminal-and-display).
- **Leaner cod...** *(release notes truncated in source)*

## Hot Issues

| # | Title | Why It Matters | Comments |
|---|-------|----------------|----------|
| [#5653](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5653) | **[inprogress] Move off Shrinkwrap** | Duplicate `pi-ai` packages on disk due to shrinkwrap hoisting breaks the API provider registry (module-level Map). Affects anyone with both `@earendil-works/pi-ai` and `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` as direct deps. | 23 |
| [#10031](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10031) | **Pi stuck in "Working..." when thinking stopped with ESC** | Frequent bug since ~v0.84.0 — users must kill pi and resume with `pi -c`. No workaround available. | 19 |
| [#9688](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9688) | **regression: clipboard copy doesn't work anymore** | OSC 52 clipboard logic now requires SSH session detection; breaks for users in interactive containers without SSH. | 9 |
| [#9255](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9255) | **Full-screen redraw storm when changed rows above viewport** | Long transcripts cause violent jumping and doubled text — TUI rendering inefficiency in fullscreen mode. | 9 |
| [#9980](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9980) | **OpenRouter cost off by 2-3x for open models** | Catalog uses cheapest provider pricing, but actual routing often picks more expensive providers — cost reporting is systematically inaccurate. | 5 |
| [#9887](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9887) | **`read` tool breaks if line numbers are strings** | Models like `xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash` send string offsets; TUI concatenates instead of adding, breaking display. | 5 |
| [#10250](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10250) | **tmux input filled with hex color garbage since 0.99.0** | New system theme default causes corrupted input in tmux 3.6/3.6a — input is unusable on startup. | 3 |
| [#10247](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10247) | **Support mcp over unix socket** | Currently only stdio and HTTP supported; Unix socket support would improve containerized and namespaced deployments. | 2 |
| [#9793](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/9793) | **Ambiguous length stop drops history far below window** | Reasoning token omission causes unexpected history compaction — streaming usage data edge case. | 3 |
| [#10319](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/10319) | **Fullscreen TUI: inline image collapses on scroll** | Follow-up to #9169 — images render initially but collapse to a strip on any scroll action. | 1 |

## 3. Hot Issues

| # | Issue | Priority | Why It Matters | Comments |
|---|-------|----------|----------------|----------|
| **#12380** | [proposal(serve): Define Managed Agent dual-path architecture and staged delivery](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12380) | P2 | Proposes a staged Managed Agent architecture with durable ownership, Workspace bindings, recoverable tool executions, and stable WebSocket lifecycle. Foundational for multi-agent and platform distribution roadmaps. | 38 |
| **#12028** | [tracking(core): non-conversation context token governance](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12028) | P2 | Addresses systemic token waste: system prompts, built-in tool schemas, context files, and skill listings are sent on every request, often dwarfing actual conversation in large-context models. Critical for cost/performance. | 18 |
| **#12867** | [feat(managed-agent): Stage D follow-ups for durable lifecycle, Turns, Actions, durable admission and AgentDefinition](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12867) | P2 | Covers Stage D delivery: durable lifecycle, Turns, Actions, `java_durable` admission profile, and AgentDefinition. API contract refinement for the managed agent stack. | 17 |
| **#12889** | [Deferred `tool_call` schema allows empty arguments for tools with required fields](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12889) | P2 | **Bug:** A deferred tool (`tool_search`) was called with empty arguments despite having required fields, causing downstream provider errors. Ready for human review. | 7 |
| **#13157** | [Agent Host: run the confinement guard before the permission flow](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/13157) | P2 | **Bug:** On Agent Host (`qwen serve --join`), out-of-workspace tool calls trigger the permission flow first, which auto-rejects under PLAN-mode escalation, killing the entire Host run. | 5 |
| **#13182** | [fix(managed-agent): retry loops without terminal states and a permanently wedged projection](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/13182) | P2 | **Bug:** Asynchronous retry loops lack terminal states; the Java broker's message projection deadlocks indefinitely. Affects managed-agent stability. | 4 |
| **#13145** | [fix(memory): MEMORY.md index truncation cuts the link target](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/13145) | P2 | **Bug:** Memory index builder truncates lines at 150 characters mid-link, breaking `[title](path.md)` resolution and leaving dangling ellipses. | 4 |
| **#13180** | [feature(managed-agent): broker authentication and broker-provisioned writer credentials](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/13180) | P2 | Designs authentication/credential layer for the Managed Agent Runtime Broker, replacing current trust arrangements with tenant/actor identity from authenticated principals. | 4 |
| **#13030** | [feat(managed-agent): Admit read-only search tools in a new Hosted Workspace profile](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/13030) | P2 | Proposes adding `list_directory`, `glob`, and `grep_search` read-only tools to the Hosted Harness for the Workspace profile. | 9 |
| **#12702** | [fix(core): deferred tools lose their "use me instead of X" rules](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12702) | P2 | **Bug:** Deferred tool "use me instead of X" guidance rules are gated on `declaredTools`, preventing the model from seeing replacement recommendations. | 4 |

## 4. Key PR Progress

| # | PR | Author | Summary |
|---|-----|--------|---------|
| **#13135** | [feat(managed-agent): reliably close workspace-bound sessions](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13135) | doudouOUC | Enables reliable close for idle Workspace-bound sessions through public and WebShell lifecycle operations with idempotent 202 admission. |
| **#13179** | [fix(managed-agent): harden commit retry, worker containment, panel polling](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13179) | wenshao | Three robustness fixes: rejects relative file paths outside workspace, pinned with new unit tests. |
| **#13146** | [fix(serve): let Web Shell trust a workspace without a terminal](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13146) | yiliang114 | Adds daemon route to record folder trust decisions, surfaces "Trust" action in Web Shell Projects panel. |
| **#13192** | [fix(managed-agent): Preserve writer and publication epoch deadlines](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13192) | yiliang114 | Corrects Unix epoch deadlines for managed writer leases and tool publication grants across JDBC/JVM/DB timezone mismatches. |
| **#13084** | [feat(managed-agent): Protect Session-owned tool output retirement](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13084) | doudouOUC | Adds permanent Session retirement, fixed-budget database reader leases, independent physical PUT attempts, candidate observation for foreground Shell output. |
| **#13156** | [fix(memory): keep MEMORY.md index link targets resolvable](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13156) | yiliang114 | Fixes index truncation to preserve link integrity; assembles lines before character limit enforcement. |
| **#13138** | [feat(managed-agent): Add offline W1b recovery bundles](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13138) | doudouOUC | Complete W1b offline recovery evidence workflow: capture recovery points, export journals, compare against storage. |
| **#13136** | [fix(managed-hooks): bound Hook admission and cold restore cost](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13136) | wenshao | Hook admission no longer reads Session history; cold Workspace load reads each Hook resource once; projects keys into indexed columns. |
| **#13033** | [feat(core): defer agent and goal declarations by default](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13033) | yiliang114 | Makes Agent/Goal coordination tools (`agent`, `list_agents`, `get_goal`, `update_goal`, `propose_goal`) discoverable on demand by default. |
| **#13151** | [feat(core): allow concurrent Bash calls in Code Mode](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/13151) | tanzhenxin | Allows Bash calls in Code Mode to run concurrently when the model uses `await Promise.allSettled([...])`. |

## 6. Developer Pain Points

- **Token Cost Opacity**: Developers are frustrated that non-conversation context (system prompts, tool schemas, skill listings) is sent on every request without visibility into actual token consumption or task success impact (#12028, #12333).
- **Managed Agent Stability**: Recurring issues with retry loops lacking terminal states, deadlocked projections, and permission flow ordering causing Host runs to crash (#13182, #13157).
- **Memory Index Corruption**: The MEMORY.md index truncation bug breaks internal link resolution, frustrating users of managed memory features (#13145).
- **Deferred Tool Guidance**: "Use me instead of X" replacement rules are gated from the model in default configuration, reducing tool optimization effectiveness (#12702).
- **CI/Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Daily CVE audits are failing (#13078), creating maintenance overhead.
