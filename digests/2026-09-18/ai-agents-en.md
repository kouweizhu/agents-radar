---

## 7. User Feedback Summary

**Pain Points Identified:**

1. **Desktop App Instability (Windows)** — Users report rendering issues at 125% scaling, sessions grouping/pinning to top bar, and the GUI breaking after Linux backend updates. Multiple duplicate reports filed (#106665, #106661, #95713).

2. **MCP Server Reliability** — External MCP servers consistently break after 60-90 seconds, causing disruption to workflows. OAuth issues compound this with callback port conflicts.

3. **Cron/Kanban Stability** — The kanban system has multiple edge cases: quota-walled retries looping forever, dependency blocks misclassified as `needs_input`, and zombie workers left after timeout.

4. **Token/Cost Management** — A recent incident burned 18.7M tokens in 5 hours; users want per-session token budgets with abort/warn capabilities.

5. **Plugin Installation** — `hermes plugins install` fails on public catalog repos due to git auth prompts being disabled.

**Positive Signals:** The Mnemosyne proposal received 8 👍 reactions, indicating community demand for expanded memory provider options. The new MCP per-server reconnect backoff feature addresses hosted HTTP API reliability concerns.

IronClaw, the AI agent benchmarking project from nearai, shows minimal activity on September 18, 2026. The project recorded **1 open issue** updated in the last 24 hours and **zero pull requests** merged or closed. No new releases were published. The sole active issue relates to daily failure taxonomy analysis for the officeqa benchmark suite, indicating ongoing performance evaluation rather than active development or bug fixing. The project appears to be in a maintenance/evaluation phase, with community focus currently on benchmarking and quality assessment rather than new feature development.

## 2. Releases

No new releases were published in the last 24 hours. The project currently has no release activity to report.

## 3. Project Progress

No pull requests were updated, merged, or closed in the last 24 hours. This represents a period of relative stagnation in code contributions or review activity for the IronClaw project.

## 4. Community Hot Topics

**Issue #8101: Daily ironclaw failure taxonomy — 2026-09-17**
- **Author**: pranavraja99
- **Created/Updated**: 2026-09-17
- **Comments**: 0 | **Reactions**: 0
- **URL**: https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/issues/8101

**Summary**: This issue documents the daily failure taxonomy analysis for the ironclaw benchmark run on 2026-09-17. The analysis focuses on the **officeqa** suite, which recorded **35 non-pass tasks**. According to the issue, these failures are described as "overwhelmingly genuine model-quality errors," with specific mention of DeepSeek-V4-Flash navigating through task failures. This indicates the project maintains a systematic approach to tracking and categorizing AI agent performance issues across different model configurations.

**Underlying Needs**: The community is focused on:
- Continuous benchmark performance monitoring
- Taxonomy of failure modes for AI agents
- Model quality assessment and comparison

## 5. Bugs & Stability

No explicit bug reports or stability issues were filed in the last 24 hours. However, Issue #8101 indirectly highlights **model-quality errors** in the officeqa benchmark suite, where 35 tasks did not pass. This suggests potential areas for investigation regarding agent performance, though these appear to be expected evaluation results rather than unexpected crashes or regressions. No fix PRs were associated with today's activity.

## 6. Feature Requests & Roadmap Signals

No explicit feature requests were filed in the last 24 hours. The current activity centers on benchmarking and performance evaluation rather than new feature proposals. The project's roadmap signals remain unclear from today's data, as no community-driven feature requests or roadmap discussions were initiated.

## 7. User Feedback Summary

Based on today's issue activity, the primary user feedback mechanism appears to be **systematic performance evaluation**. The failure taxonomy issue indicates users/maintainers are actively:
- Running benchmarks against different model configurations
- Categorizing and analyzing failure patterns
- Tracking model-quality issues across benchmark suites

The lack of comments or reactions on Issue #8101 suggests this may be an automated or internal tracking process rather than community-driven feedback. No direct user pain points, use cases, or satisfaction/dissatisfaction signals were explicitly reported today.

## 8. Backlog Watch

Given the limited activity (only 1 issue in 24 hours), there are no clearly identifiable long-unanswered important Issues or PRs requiring maintainer attention from today's data alone. The project shows no signs of neglected community contributions or stalled reviews that would warrant urgent maintainer intervention.

---

## 7. User Feedback Summary

### Pain Points

- **SubAgent timeouts**: Multiple users on Windows 2.2.0/2.2.1 report that spawned subAgents universally fail, even with extended timeout settings.
- **Context explosion**: Users report context window exceeding configured limits (set to 131K but hitting 271K), with compression not triggering as expected (#7810).
- **Console UI instability**: Lazy loading failures leave users stuck; backend-ready timing issues cause blank panels at startup (#7841).
- **Plugin isolation**: Synchronous plugin operations freeze the entire deployment — a significant risk for production deployments.

### Satisfaction Signals

- **Hub improvements** (#7779) received positive engagement for governance and model management.
- **Docker runtime alignment** (#7751) resolves long-standing environment discrepancies.
- **Voice chat** (#7785) is generating interest as a new interaction mode.

Several active issues remain in progress with three comments each, covering ACP session tools, Matrix voice functionality, agent parity testing, and an Anthropic provider caching problem. The issue #9882 appears to be cut off mid-description.

Several high-priority security and stability concerns are emerging. Image markers are bypassing content validation in the model query execution path, which could expose vulnerabilities. Additionally, there are RFC proposals for durable primitives addressing agent-to-human questions and message delivery receipts, along with a Telegram voice transcript feature request. Runtime command replies are also incorrectly entering conversational voice routing, and WhatsApp Web is ignoring voice suppression settings. These issues span security, feature development, and cross-platform consistency.

The project is also addressing streaming text guard suppression problems when tool-result-shaped objects appear in prose, extracting cron functionality into a dedicated crate, and investigating a Windows control plane liveness test race condition. Image marker handling remains a significant concern, with literal markers in tool output being promoted to malformed provider images. The team is working on context compaction features and coordinating agent lifecycle mutations through a comprehensive runtime refactoring. #10855 - docs(governance): implement RFC vote simplification - Audacity88
#10834 - docs(adr): record runtime security provenance boundaries - Audacity88

#10672 - fix(zerocode): avoid duplicate streamed responses - Audacity88
#10696 - fix(runtime): trim history to a low-water target instead of the cap - Audacity88
#10804 - fix(runtime): scope cost tracking into delegated sub-loops and enforce per-agent ceilings - Audacity88
#10860 - fix(providers): keep non-image data-URI markers in tool results as text - Audacity88

The project has six PRs that were closed or merged, with the majority of recent work coming from Audacity88 who appears across multiple fixes and features. There are several focused bug fixes addressing runtime trimming, cost tracking, and provider functionality, alongside documentation improvements for RFC processes and security boundaries. The maintainers are actively working through webhook, streaming response, and approval-related issues.</think>

| #10526 | RFC: Append-only session event history, deterministic state replay | 11 | [#10526](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/10526) |
| #4853 | [Feature]: install skills from .well-known agent-skills discovery indexes | 7 | [#4853](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/4853) |
| #9899 | [Tracker]: triage and remove bitmaps unmaintained advisory waiver (RUSTSEC-2026-0247) | 5 | [#9899](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/issues/9899) |

**Analysis:** The RFC queue (#8692) is the central coordination hub, with maintainers actively working through design issues. RFC #10549 proposes streamlining the voting process by removing mandatory discussion windows—a governance improvement that could accelerate decision-making. RFC #10526 addresses a fundamental architectural need: consolidating fragmented session state across TurnEvents, logs, tool receipts, and process-local state into an append-only event history model.

## Bugs & Stability

**High-severity bugs reported:**

| Issue | Title | Severity | Status | Fix PR |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| #10854 | [Bug]: Literal image marker in tool output is promoted into malformed provider image | S1 - workflow blocked | in-progress | — |
| #10912 | [Bug]: Streaming text guard suppresses whole replies when prose quotes a tool-result-shaped object | S2 - degraded | in-progress | — |
| #10408 | [Bug]: second message during an active turn starts a parallel run → duplicate work | S2 - degraded | in-progress | — |
| #10889 | [Bug]: native Anthropic provider drops rolling cache breakpoint when last message ends with image block | S2 - degraded | accepted | — |
| #10908 | [Bug]: Image markers in tool-result text are promoted to attachments without provenance | S2 - degraded | accepted | — |
| #9882 | Image markers bypass content validation on the run_model_query direct-dispatch seam | S2 - degraded | in-progress | — |

**Test stability issues:**

- **#10875** — Telegram media-group tests fail intermittently on unrelated PRs (Parallel Runtime Test) — *priority: p1, in-progress*
- **#10805** — control_plane liveness tests race process teardown on Windows — *priority: p2, in-progress*

**Note:** Multiple bugs relate to image marker parsing (#10854, #10908, #9882, #10860) indicating a systemic area needing hardening. The fix in #10860 (merged) addresses data-URI validation, but the broader image marker handling stack still requires attention.

## User Feedback Summary

Real pain points observed from issue discussions:

1. **Duplicate agent runs**: Issue #10408 reports users experiencing duplicate work and duplicate replies when sending a second message during an active turn—*direct UX degradation*.
2. **Nix installation path confusion**: Issue #5269 (now closed) highlighted that `cargo binstall zeroclaw` documentation was missing—user onboarding friction.
3. **Voice transcript invisibility**: Users cannot see STT transcription of their voice notes, making it impossible to detect speech-recognition errors (#10932).
4. **Image marker false positives**: Tool-output text containing `[IMAGE:...]` shaped strings is being misprocessed as actual images, causing malformed provider requests (#10854, #10908).
5. **Telegram test flakiness**: Intermittent CI failures on unrelated PRs (#10875) frustrate contributors and block merges.
