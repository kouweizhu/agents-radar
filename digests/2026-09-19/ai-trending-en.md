16. ahmedkhaleel2004/gitdiagram - NOT AI-related (diagram tool)
17. asciimoo/hister - NOT AI-related (search engine)

**AI Topic Search (81 repos):**
All seem AI-related based on topics: rag, ml, llm-model, vector-db, ai-agent, llm

Now let me categorize:


- **AI Infrastructure**: cloudflare/security-audit-skill, anthropics/claude-code, alibaba/open-code-review, affaan-m/ECC, Tencent/BrowserSkill, addyosmani/agent-skills, TencentCloud/Octop, Fission-AI/OpenSpec, coder/coder, plus the foundational models like langchain, llama_index, transformers

, Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm, infiniflow/ragflow

Now I'm organizing this into a report with tables showing each project alongside its language, star count, and a brief description of what it does.</think>

# AI Open Source Trends Report — September 19, 2026

## 1. Today's Highlights

The AI open-source ecosystem is experiencing a **massive surge in coding agent tooling**, with three major developments leading today's trending: Cloudflare's security-audit skill (+3,006 stars), Alibaba's open-code-review (+2,704 stars), and Tencent's BrowserSkill (+1,306 stars). This indicates a clear market validation of **agentic coding workflows** as the next frontier for developer productivity. The emergence of production-grade engineering skills (addyosmann/agent-skills) and agent harness optimization (ECC) suggests the ecosystem is maturing beyond prototype agents toward robust, deployable systems. Notably, Anthropic's Claude Code itself is trending (+444 stars), signaling vendor momentum in the terminal-based agent space.

## 3. Trend Signal Analysis

Today's data reveals a **clear inflection point in coding agent infrastructure**. The three fastest-growing projects (Cloudflare security-audit skill, Alibaba code review, Tencent BrowserSkill) all share a common theme: **specialized, production-ready agent skills** rather than generic agent frameworks. This suggests the market is moving from "build an agent" to "deploy an agent" phase.

The emergence of **browser automation for agents** (BrowserSkill) and **production engineering skills** (addyosmani's agent-skills) indicates the ecosystem is maturing toward **tooling parity** with human developers. The hybrid deterministic + LLM approach seen in Alibaba's code review tool represents a significant architectural trend: **combining rule-based precision with LLM flexibility**.

In the broader topic data, **knowledge graph RAG** (Graphify) is gaining massive traction (119K stars), signaling a shift from pure vector retrieval toward structured knowledge representation. The continued growth of memory/persistence layers (mem0, cognee, supermemory) confirms that **stateful, persistent agents** are the next frontier.

This aligns with recent industry developments: Anthropic's Claude Code launch, OpenAI's agent SDK pushes, and the broader enterprise adoption wave driving need for production-grade agent infrastructure.

## 4. Community Hot Spots

- **[cloudflare/security-audit-skill](https://github.com/cloudflare/security-audit-skill)** — First-mover in verified, machine-readable security findings for agents; 3,006 stars in one day signals urgent developer demand for secure-by-default agent tooling.

- **[alibaba/open-code-review](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review)** — Battle-tested at Alibaba scale; the hybrid pipeline + LLM architecture is a template for enterprise-grade code analysis.

- **[Graphify-Labs/graphify](https://github.com/Graphify-Labs/graphify)** — Transforms codebases into queryable knowledge graphs; the "skill for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex" positioning makes it essential for developer workflows.

- **[mem0ai/mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)** — Production-grade memory layer for agents; addresses the critical stateful agent problem with 65K+ stars proving market validation.

- **[CopilotKit/CopilotKit](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit)** — AG-UI Protocol is emerging as a standard for frontend-agent integration; watch for ecosystem lock-in potential.
