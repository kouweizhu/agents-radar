# Cross-Project Comparison: AI Inference & Serving Ecosystem

## 1. Ecosystem Overview

The AI inference stack is in a phase of aggressive horizontal expansion across three vectors: **hardware heterogeneity** (Blackwell, RDNA, Hexagon, Apple Silicon, Intel Arc), **memory hierarchy sophistication** (extensible KV cache, GPU-resident MoE caches, heterogeneous memory support), and **deployment topology diversification** (disaggregated prefill-decode, speculative decoding, multi-model serving). Each project occupies a distinct layer position, but competitive pressure is driving feature parity faster than ever—the gap between vLLM's extensible KV cache and SGLang's HiCache is narrowing rapidly. Simultaneously, llama.cpp continues its unique position as the only runtime targeting consumer CPU + Apple Silicon + embedded DSPs, while LiteLLM abstracts away provider diversity at the gateway layer.

## 2. Activity Comparison

| Project | Issues (Open) | Key Issues | PRs (Last 24h) | Releases (24h) |
|---------|---------------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **vLLM** | ~12 active | SM120 crashes, scheduler hangs, ROCm stability | ~15 merged | None |
| **SGLang** | ~8 active | CUDA OOM at concurrency, GLM SM120 crash, EAGLE regression | ~12 merged | None |
| **llama.cpp** | ~6 active | Multi-GPU MTP bug, Vulkan regression | ~10 merged | 5 commits (b11345–b11364) |

| **LiteLLM** | ~10 active | Budget bypass, Redis cluster hang, spend logging | ~12 merged | v1.105.0-dev.2 |
| **Unsloth** | ~8 active | VRAM OOM, decode regression, tool calls | ~10 merged | None |

**Observations:**
- **llama.cpp** leads in commit velocity despite no formal "release" tag—typical of its continuous delivery model.
- **vLLM and SGLang** show high issue counts correlating with Blackwell (SM120) hardware maturity challenges.
- **Ollama and LiteLLM** issues skew toward operational reliability (cloud service, installer, budget enforcement) rather than core inference correctness.

## 4. Performance Frontier

| Optimization Area | vLLM | SGLang | llama.cpp | Ollama | Unsloth |
|-------------------|------|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **KV Cache Extensibility** | 🔥 Extensible KV (#56492) | HiCache write-back | — | — | — |
| **Memory Offload (Sleep)** | ✅ CUDA graph pool offload | — | GPU-resident MoE LRU | MLX weight unwire fix | — |
| **Speculative Decoding** | MTP fixes | DSpark dynamic verify | — | — | — |
| **Quantization** | NVFP4 MLA | MXFP4 MoE (AMD) | q2_k/q3_k (Hexagon) | MXFP8 (MLX) | BNB 4-bit fix |
| **Kernel Performance** | FlashInfer downloader | — | CUDA TOP_K radix sort, Vulkan RMS norm | — | — |
| **Batching** | Priority-aware metrics | PD hybrid draft KV slice | — | — | — |
| **Multi-GPU / Distributed** | — | TP-slice hybrid | Multi-GPU MTP (⚠️ regression) | — | Multi-GPU (Studio gap) |

**Frontier Concentration:**
- **vLLM and SGLang** are in a direct race on heterogeneous KV cache management (device/host/p2p/disk), a capability critical for 128K+ context workloads.
- **llama.cpp** owns the CPU/embedded optimization frontier—CUDA TOP_K and Vulkan RMS norm are their highest-impact items this cycle.
- **Unsloth** focuses on fine-tuning efficiency (LoRA + QAT preservation) rather than inference optimization.

## 5. Layer Positioning

| Layer | Projects | Position Description |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| **Training / Fine-tuning** | Unsloth | Consumer GPU fine-tuning with LoRA, QAT, multi-GPU |
| **Local Runtime** | llama.cpp, Ollama | Full inference engine for CPU/Apple Silicon/embedded |
| **Serving Engine** | vLLM, SGLang | Production-grade GPU serving with scheduler, KV cache, speculative decoding |
| **Gateway / Abstraction** | LiteLLM | Multi-provider OpenAI-compatible API with budget, rate limiting, observability |
| **Hybrid** | Ollama | End-user local deployment + cloud sync, bridges to LiteLLM via OpenAI compat |

**Competitive Boundaries:**
- **vLLM ↔ SGLang**: Direct competition on GPU serving—they are rapidly converging on features (KV cache extensibility, speculative decoding, PD disaggregation).
- **llama.cpp ↔ Ollama**: llama.cpp provides the engine; Ollama wraps it for end-user accessibility. Ollama adds orchestration, cloud sync, and MLX backend.
- **LiteLLM** operates orthogonally—it sits in front of all these engines plus cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock) as a translation/proxy layer.
- **Unsloth** occupies a unique niche: fine-tuning, not inference. It trains models that then run on vLLM/SGLang/llama.cpp/Ollama.

## 6. Trend Signals

### What Agent / Application Developers Should Watch

| Signal | Implication | Projects Affected |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Blackwell (SM120) instability** | Avoid production deployment on RTX PRO 6000 / RTX 5080 for CUDA graph or speculative decoding workloads. Triton backend is more stable than fa4. | vLLM, SGLang |
| **Extensible KV cache shipping** | Will enable 128K+ context with heterogeneous memory (disk/p2p/host). Monitor for API stability. Expect production-ready in Q1 2027. | vLLM |
| **Multi-model GGUF serving** | Unsloth Studio and llama.cpp enabling multiple concurrent GGUF models—simplifies multi-tenant deployments. | Unsloth, llama.cpp |
| **Budget enforcement bugs** | Self-hosted LiteLLM users: verify budget limits are actually enforced in your version. | LiteLLM |
| **MLX memory behavior change** | Apple Silicon users: weights unpinned ~2s after each request. Factor in re-page latency for latency-sensitive apps. | Ollama |
| **Tool calling reliability improving** | LiteLLM and SGLang both fixed tool-call ordering / chunk boundary issues—less breakage in agentic workflows. | LiteLLM, SGLang |
| **Provider expansion accelerating** | LiteLLM adding ~3 providers per cycle. If you need a specific model/backend, check LiteLLM first—it may already be abstracted. | LiteLLM |

### Industry Trends (Inferred from Activity)

1. **Heterogeneous memory hierarchies are the next frontier** — KV cache extensibility (vLLM), GPU-resident MoE caches (llama.cpp), and sleep-mode CUDA graph offload (vLLM) all target the same goal: utilizing host/disk memory for models that exceed GPU VRAM.

2. **Speculative decoding is moving beyond pure speed** — DSpark's dynamic verify width and Ngram support indicate the focus is shifting from "does it work?" to "does it preserve quality at scale?" (see EAGLE prefix collapse bug in SGLang).

3. **AMD ROCm is catching up** — MI355X (gfx950) now has Triton kernel support for MXFP4 MoE and fp32 router GEMM. If you're CUDA-limited, AMD MI300X/MI355X is becoming viable.

4. **Quantization is fragmenting** — NVFP4 (Blackwell), MXFP4 (AMD), MXFP8 (Apple), Q2_K/Q3_K (Hexagon), GGUF IQ3 (llama.cpp). No single quantization format dominates across hardware. LiteLLM's abstraction helps here.

5. **Local + cloud convergence** — Ollama's cloud sync + LiteLLM compatibility layer + Unsloth training creates a continuum from local consumer GPU to enterprise cloud deployment. The boundaries between "local model" and "API model" are blurring at the tooling layer.

---

## 6. What This Means for Application Developers

1. **Speculative decoding users**: If using EAGLE with radix caching on GLM models, be aware of silent prefix reuse collapse — monitor your cache hit rates (#32459).

2. **H20 / concurrent request workloads**: The CUDA illegal memory access issue at 8 concurrent requests may require workarounds (`CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` or `--disable-overlap-schedule`) until root cause is confirmed (#37633).

3. **SM120 (RTX PRO 6000) users**: FlashAttention 4 backend has stability issues with GLM-5.3-Flash; use Triton backend as fallback (#42012).

4. **DeepSeek V4 / V4.1 users**: Ongoing optimization work; expect continued perf improvements. Watch for memory overhead on SM120 with FP8 paged MQA logits (#42146).

5. **AMD ROCm users**: Quark MXFP4 MoE models now work on RDNA (gfx1151) via triton_kernels — good progress on AMD GPU support (#41389).

6. **Streaming sessions**: New behavior in #42295 enforces `UnifiedRadixCache` for streaming sessions; tree caches that don't support streaming will be rejected.

## Stability & Regressions

| Severity | Issue | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **High** | [#27428](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/27428) | **Multi-GPU MTP bug**: draft-mtp roughly halves prompt processing on layer-split configs; single GPU unaffected (25 comments) |

---

## What This Means for Application Developers

1. **Metal users**: The new F16 KV flash attention kernel with ALiBi/logit softcap support enables better accuracy on newer attention schemes — update builds to b11362+ if using Gemma 4 or similar models.

2. **Multi-GPU inference with MTP**: Avoid the current multi-GPU layer-split + draft-mtp configuration (#27428) — fallback to single-GPU or disable MTP until the prompt processing regression is resolved.

3. **Vulkan on Samsung/Qualcomm**: Samsung GPUs with 32KB shared memory now have large matmul tiles disabled for stability. Qualcomm Adreno users should monitor #29786 — the driver causes silent aborts with no error output.

4. **Server API expansion**: The `/v1/systemone` endpoint (b11361) adds support for new model architectures — check the [model list](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/29818) if integrating LLaMA-compatible endpoints.

5. **SYCL/Intel**: Ongoing IQ3 reordering and GLM MLA optimizations (PRs #29107, #29171) improve Arc B70 performance; OpenVINO updated to 2026.4.1 with improved MoE support.

6. **Memory-constrained deployments**: The GPU-resident LRU cache for MoE expert weights (#27861) reduces host RAM bandwidth pressure when using `-ot ...exps=CPU` or `-ncmoe` configurations.

## 3. New Model & Hardware Support

| Item | Description | PR/Issue |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **GraniteForCausalLM in MLX** | Added support for IBM's Granite 4.1/4.2 dense language models in the MLX backend and mlxrunner | [#17972](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/pull/17972) |
| **Qwen 3.8 27b-mxfp8 on Mac MLX** | Support for Qwen 3.8 27b with MXFP8 quantization on Apple Silicon via MLX | [#18754](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/18754) |

| **Qwen3.8:27b has undocumented Ollama version requirement** | Medium | Open | — |

---

## 6. What This Means for Application Developers

1. **Avoid v0.35.1 Windows installer** — The Authenticode signature verification fails. If you automate Ollama installs on Windows, you may need to pin to v0.34.x or disable signature checks until resolved.

2. **Tool calling reliability improving** — Two PRs (#18763, #18759) address tool result ordering and chunk boundary issues. If you use parallel tool calls via the OpenAI-compatible API, these fixes will reduce attribution errors.

3. **MLX memory behavior changed** — If you run on Apple Silicon, expect model weights to be unpinned ~2s after each request. For latency-sensitive applications with repeated inference, consider keeping a warm request alive or factor in re-page-in time.

4. **Cloud reliability issues** — If you're using Ollama Cloud Pro, the 95% failure rate across all models suggests service-side problems. Monitor #15453 for updates or consider falling back to local inference.

5. **Vision models may be broken** — Llama3.2-vision broke in a recent update. If your app uses vision capabilities, test carefully or pin to a known-working Ollama version.

<summary><strong>LiteLLM</strong> — <a href="https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm">BerriAI/litellm</a></summary>

<think>The user wants me to generate a LiteLLM digest based on the GitHub data provided. Let me analyze the data and organize it according to the requested sections.

Let me go through the data:

**Releases:**
- v1.105.0-dev.2 released
- Docker images now signed with cosign

**Issues (bugs, features):**
- Budget enforcement bypassed in v1.82.3 (#26672) - 20 comments, high severity
- Stdio MCP not working (#15560) - 10 comments
- reasoning_effort='none' capability gate ignores base_model (#31243) - 7 comments
- REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES causes proxy shutdown to fail (#31206) - 4 comments
- MCP tool auto-execution silently skipped for ollama_chat (#31911) - 4 comments
- Spend logs record $0 for custom models (#35691) - 4 comments
- Bedrock cross-region inference pricing issues (#24669) - 3 comments
- RateLimitError doesn't distinguish insufficient_quota from retryable 429s (#32785) - 3 comments
- Feature: Support aggregate shared-wallet budget fallback to economy models (#43652) - 3 comments
- OTLP span events decoded but dropped before ClickHouse (#44274) - 2 comments
- Various other UI and bug issues

**Pull Requests:**
- fix(proxy): share ownership permissions for spend logs and traces (#44239)
- feat(proxy): add opt-in vector_store_deny_by_default (#44244)
- fix(otel): name postgres service spans by operation and table (#44240)
- fix(anthropic): degrade reasoning effort only when capability is false (#40241)
- feat: add CoralBricks provider (#35957)


- fix(anthropic): remap disabled thinking to between_tools on Sonnet 5.5 (#44299)
- chore(release): backport to rc/1.104.0 and bump oauthlib (#44304)
- fix(azure): respect retry limits in cached SDK clients (#44204)
- fix(vector_stores): return managed file ids from vector store file list (#43800)
- feat: add Reka as OpenAI-compatible provider (#44278)
- feat(providers): add QuickSilver Pro (#44303)
- fix(agentic): preserve provider prefixes for organization models (#44189)

The PRs are adding support for new providers like CoralBricks, Reka, and QuickSilver Pro, while also addressing bugs in vector stores and agentic features. There are fixes for reasoning effort handling in Anthropic models, OAuthlib updates, and improvements to how Azure SDK clients manage retry logic.

On the infrastructure side, I'm working on better span naming for PostgreSQL operations, adding cache token counts to OpenTelemetry traces, and improving dashboard caching. The team is also implementing team-owned tags for cost tracking, investigating performance issues with prompt-cache tokenization, and adding fallback logic for aggregate shared-wallet budgets. There are several stability issues being addressed, including budget enforcement bypasses and Redis cluster problems.

I've also identified potential vulnerabilities related to anyio's locking mechanism and discovered billing errors where ultrafast service tiers are undercounted. Several providers are being added including Reka, QuickSilver Pro, and CoralBricks, while Amazon Nova 2 Pro pricing has been corrected. Multiple regressions and bugs across the proxy, LLM translation, and UI components are in progress.</think>

# LiteLLM Digest — 2026-10-03

## 1. Today's Highlights

Docker image signatures are now verified via **cosign** — all LiteLLM releases are signed with a consistent key (`0112e53`). Meanwhile, the project continues expanding multi-provider support with **Reka** and **QuickSilver Pro** added as first-class OpenAI-compatible providers. Critical budget enforcement bypass in v1.82.3 (#26672) remains active with 20 comments — worth tracking if you operate self-hosted proxy deployments.

## 2. Releases & Breaking Changes

| Release | Notes | PR/Commit |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **v1.105.0-dev.2** | Development build | [GitHub](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/releases/tag/v1.105.0-dev.2) |
| **Cosign signing** | All Docker images now signed with cosign. Verify with `cosign verify` using key from commit `0112e53`. | [Commit](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/commit/0112e53046018d726492c814b3644b7d376029d0) |

---

## 3. New Model & Hardware Support

- **Reka** — New first-class provider added as OpenAI-compatible (`reka/`). Reads `REKA_API_KEY` and `REKA_API_BASE`. [#44278](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44278)
- **QuickSilver Pro** — Added as JSON-configured OpenAI-compatible provider. [#44303](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44303)
- **CoralBricks** — Added provider support for GLM 5.3, GLM 5.3 Flash, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash models with built-in cost tracking. [#35957](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/35957)
- **Amazon Nova 2 Pro (Preview)** — Pricing corrected to standard tier ($1.25 / $10 per 1M tokens). [#44302](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44302)
- **xAI Grok Imagine** — Added native support for image generation, edit, and video download. [#40238](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/40238)
- **Anthropic Sonnet 5.5** — Fixed thinking disable remapping: `disabled` now maps to `between_tools` (the model's documented off-equivalent). [#44299](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44299)
- **Claude Code → GPT-5** — Fixed capability gate for `reasoning_effort='none'` on Azure GPT-5 custom deployments. [#31243](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/31243)

---

## 4. Performance & Optimization

- **Prompt-cache eligibility** — Stopped full conversation tokenization to determine cache eligibility. This should reduce latency on cache checks for large chat histories. [#44221](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44221)
- **Postgres span naming** — OTEL spans now named by operation and table (e.g., `db.operation.name`) instead of generic Python helper names. Improves observability in tracing dashboards. [#44240](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44240)
- **OTEL cache token counts** — Cache read/write token counts now exported as span attributes per OTEL GenAI semantic conventions. [#43992](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/43992)
- **Azure SDK retry limits** — Fixed cached SDK clients ignoring `max_retries` — calls requesting zero retries could reuse clients configured to retry. Now respects per-call retry limits. [#44204](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44204)
- **CI parallelization** — Security tests now run in parallel to reduce CI wall-clock time. [#44146](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44146)

---

## 5. Stability & Regressions

| Severity | Issue | Status | Fix PR |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| **High** | **Budget enforcement bypassed** — key/user `max_budget` not enforced in v1.82.3 despite spend exceeding limit. | [OPEN #26672](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/26672) | — |
| **High** | **REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES causes proxy shutdown failure** — graceful shutdown hangs when cluster mode is enabled. | [OPEN #31206](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/31206) | — |
| **Medium** | **MCP tool auto-execution silently skipped** — `ollama_chat`/`base` models skip server-side MCP tool execution even with `require_approval: "never"`. | [OPEN #31911](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/31911) | — |
| **Medium** | **Spend logs record $0** — custom models not in built-in cost map record `total_cost = 0` in spend logs despite correct `estimated_cost`. | [OPEN #35691](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/35691) | — |
| **Medium** | **RateLimitError conflates billing vs. retryable** — `insufficient_quota` (billing failure) treated as retryable 429, causing retry loops on billing errors. | [OPEN #32785](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/32785) | — |
| **Medium** | **anyio dependency floor** — no declared version floor, exposing LiteLLM to known lock-waiter-deadlock bug (agronholm/anyio#1145). | [OPEN #44048](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/44048) | — |
| **Medium** | **Custom pricing undercounted 6x** — ultrafast-tier deployments override standard rates but bill at standard pricing. | [CLOSED #43868](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/43868) | — |
| **Low** | **OTLP span events dropped** — generic OTLP spans with nested events lose event names/attributes before ClickHouse storage. | [OPEN #44274](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/44274) | — |
| **Low** | **Bedrock cross-region pricing unreachable** — region-specific pricing never matched due to lookup order; always falls back to base model. | [CLOSED #24669](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/24669) | — |

---

## 6. What This Means for Application Developers

- **If you use custom model pricing or budget limits** — verify your deployment version isn't affected by the v1.82.3 budget bypass bug. Consider upgrading once a fix lands.
- **If you use Ollama with MCP tools** — server-side auto-execution is currently broken for `ollama_chat`/`base` models. You'll need to handle tool execution client-side or watch for a fix.
- **If you use Redis in cluster mode** — be aware proxy graceful shutdown may hang. Plan accordingly for deployments with `REDIS_CLUSTER_NODES`.
- **If you track costs by team** — new team-owned tags feature (#44289) prevents cross-team tag pollution in spend logs. Worth adopting for multi-tenant deployments.
- **If you need fine-grained vector store access** — the new `vector_store_deny_by_default` opt-in (#44244) provides least-privilege access control for vector stores.
- **If you use Azure with retry configurations** — verify your explicit retry settings are being respected (recent fix landed in #44204).

## 6. What This Means for Application Developers

1. **Deployment options expanding** — Unsloth Desktop is now installable via `nix` on NixOS/Nix distributions ([#11135](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/11135)).

2. **GGUF serving getting more sophisticated** — The multi-resident GGUF model PR ([#10876](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/10876)) will allow running multiple GGUF models simultaneously, each in its own llama.cpp process. If you manage model fleets, this simplifies multi-tenant setups.

3. **Watch for regressions** — The tensor-split decode slowdown ([#12468](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/1244)) and OpenAI API latency add ([#12364](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/12364)) affect inference throughput. If you're running multi-GPU GGUF inference or using the OpenAI-compatible endpoint, benchmark before production deployment.

4. **Fine-tuning VRAM concerns persist** — Issue #4504 reports fine-tuning using significantly more VRAM than expected. If you're hitting OOMs on large models, this is a known gap.

5. **Tool calling improvements** — Several PRs address tool use in Studio: improved tool call retention in history ([#12574](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/12574)), JSON export fix for tool results ([#12579](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/12579)), and a fix for Gemma 4 training on tool results ([#12575](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/pull/12575)). These improve reliability for agentic workflows.
